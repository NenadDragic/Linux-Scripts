# Delete Files Starting with Tilde (~) Script
This script (`delete_tilde_files.sh`) finds and deletes all files in the `/volume1/Dragic` directory and any subdirectories that have names starting with a tilde (~) and containing a period (.) on a Linux system using the `find` command.

## Usage
1. Make sure you have permission to execute the script. If not, run the following command to grant permission:

```bash
chmod +x delete_tilde_files.sh
````

2. Execute the script by running the following command:

```bash
./delete_tilde_files.sh
```

The script will search for and delete all files in the `/volume1/Dragic` directory and any subdirectories that have names starting with a tilde (~) and containing a period (.).

## Explanation
The script uses the `find` command to search for files in the `/volume1/Dragic` directory and any subdirectories that have names starting with a tilde (~) and containing a period (.), and then deletes them.

* `find /volume1/Dragic -name "~*.*" -type f -delete 2>/dev/null`: This command finds all files in the `/volume1/Dragic` directory and any subdirectories that have names starting with a tilde (~) and containing a period (.) and deletes them. The `2>/dev/null` part of the command redirects any error messages to the null device, effectively discarding them.
