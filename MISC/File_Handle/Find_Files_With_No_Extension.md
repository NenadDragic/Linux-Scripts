# Find Command: Find All Files Without Extensions

This command (`find . -type f ! -name '*.*'`) is designed to find all files in the current directory and its subdirectories that do not have a file extension.

## Explanation
The command uses the `find` command to search for files in the directory hierarchy. The command's syntax is as follows:

```bash
find . -type f ! -name '*.*'
```

Here's an explanation of each element of the command:

* `find`: This is the command used to search for files and directories in a directory hierarchy.
* `.`: This argument specifies the starting directory for the search. In this case, it is the current directory.
* ``-type f`: This flag filters the search results, only returning files (not directories).
* `!`: This operator negates the condition that follows, returning only files that do not meet the condition.
* `-name '*.*'`: This condition specifies files with a period (i.e., files with extensions). By using ! -name '*.*', we exclude files with extensions, returning only files without extensions.

When the command is executed, the find command searches the current directory and its subdirectories for files without extensions, printing the paths of the found files to the console.

Overall, this command is useful for users who want to quickly find all files in a directory and its subdirectories that do not have a file extension.
