# Find Command: Find Files Whose Names Begin with Capital Letters

This command (`find . -type f -regex './[A-Z]*'`) is designed to find all files in the current directory and its subdirectories whose filenames begin with a capital letter.

## Explanation
The command uses the `find` command to search for files in the directory hierarchy. The command's syntax is as follows:

```console
find . -type f -regex './[A-Z]*'
```

Here's an explanation of each element of the command:

* `find`: This is the command used to search for files and directories in a directory hierarchy.
* `.`: This argument specifies the starting directory for the search. In this case, it is the current directory.
* `-type f`: This flag filters the search results, only returning files (not directories).
* `-regex './[A-Z]*'`: This option specifies a regular expression pattern that the filenames must match. The pattern ./[A-Z]* matches filenames that begin with a capital letter.

When the command is executed, the `find` command searches the current directory and its subdirectories for files whose filenames begin with a capital letter, printing the paths of the found files to the console.

Overall, this command is useful for users who want to quickly find all files in a directory and its subdirectories whose filenames begin with a capital letter.
