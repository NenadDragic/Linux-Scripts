# VUE Update Script

This Bash script is designed to download, extract and install the VueScan application on a Linux system. It must be run with root privileges due to the changes it makes to the system.

Here's a brief description of each section of the script:

1. **Root Privilege Check:** The script checks if the user has root privileges. If not, it outputs a message asking to be run as root and then exits.

2. **File Download and Extraction:** The script downloads a `.tar.gz` file from the provided URL and then extracts the file.

3. **File Copying:** The script copies the necessary VueScan files into their appropriate directories:

   - `vuescan.svg` to `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/`
   - `vuescan.rul` to `/lib/udev/rules.d/60-vuescan.rules`
   - `vuescan` to `/usr/bin/`

4. **Package Purging:** The script purges the `ippusbxd` and `ipp-usb` packages from the system using `apt`. This is presumably because these packages can cause conflicts with VueScan.

5. **Udev Rules Reload:** After all changes are made, the script reloads the Udev rules so that the system recognizes the changes.

Please note that you need to replace the `url="https://example.com/somefile.tar.gz"` with the actual URL of your VueScan tar.gz file.

Finally, to run the script, make it executable with `chmod +x <filename>`, then run it using `./<filename>`, replacing `<filename>` with the actual name of your script file.
